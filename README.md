Super Mario Game

This is a Rogue like game based on the renowned Super Mario game by Nintendo. The game 
came with a basecode and a pre-coded simple engine.
A small team worked on the engine and added new features, namely : new skills, abilities for the player (Mario),interactive objects around the game world.
We were tasked to adhere to the SOLID software design principles during the development of the game and so we delivered with our best version with this project.
