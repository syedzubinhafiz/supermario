/**
 * This module is about the grounds within the game.
 * <p>
 * This module explores the different grounds that can exist on the map.
 * Each ground has different functionality and way of being dealt by actors, and some grounds are
 * related to each other (ie: Tree and its subclasses).
 * Note that all grounds in this package extend the abstract ground class in engine package.
