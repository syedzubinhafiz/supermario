/**
 * This module is about the items that can be used/seen within the edu.monash.fit2099.game.
 * <p>
 * This module explores the different items that can be used in this edu.monash.fit2099.game.
 * Note that Wallet class does not extend item abstract class from engine package, while the other items
 * in this package do. Thus, the reason why Wallet is here is because it still represents an item,
 * just that Wallet is not used like how an item is used in this particular edu.monash.fit2099.game
 * (allows player to have capabilities/provides actions to actor).
