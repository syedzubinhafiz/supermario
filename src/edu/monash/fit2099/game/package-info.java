/**
 * This module is about all the functionality specific to the Mario edu.monash.fit2099.game we are developing.
 * <p>
 * This module keeps track of ALL related classes, packages, interfaces, enums and abstract classes
 * related to the Mario edu.monash.fit2099.game.
 * In this module, there are two classes not in individual packages:
 * 1) The driver class Application
 * 2) The Utils class
 * This is because Utils class is a standalone class that is used by most other classes just for its methods
 * Also, the driver Application class is the class starting the program, thus it should be placed outside of
 * all the individual packages.
 * </p>
